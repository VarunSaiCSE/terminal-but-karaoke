# terminal-but-karaoke

Ever wished your terminal could sing?  
Now it can. Welcome to **my repo** — your command-line karaoke machine.

It plays your favorite tracks, syncs the lyrics, and drops ASCII goodness like a rockstar.  
No GUI. No distractions. Just pure, unfiltered terminal music madness.
